# Diversifolio

Diversifolio is a tool for personal portfolio keeping and is not meant to be used by a general audience.

It loads free market data from Moscow Exchange [Informational & Statistical Server].
It reads portfolio positions from SQLite database.
For Tinkoff the data can be fetched via legacy [OpenAPI]; newer [Invest API] is yet to be supported.

## How to use

Add `PopulateScriptDirectory` value to the config. 
For example, `src/RazorRunner/appsettings.Development.json`:
```json
{
  "DetailedErrors": true,
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "PopulateScriptDirectory": "~/â€¦/portfolio-data/scripts/"
}
```
